What he masterfully achieves in just two-part film adaptations of the historical epic (originally written in five volumes) is nothing short of exemplary work by a filmmaker who\u2019s successfully stayed relevant with his work for four decades. With Ponniyin Selvan 2 aka PS 2, Ratnam shows how one can still make historical films without relying too much on grand, over-the-top action sequences but purely on drama that keeps you pinned right till the end.\r\nPonniyin Selvan 2 review: Aishwarya Rai plays Nandini in the movie.\r\nPonniyin Selvan 2 review: Aishwarya Rai plays Nandini in the movie.\r\n\r\nAfter a backstory about the beginning of the relationship between Aditha Karikalan and Nandini as teenagers, the story continues from where the first part ended. As Vandhiyathevan (Karthi) learns that plans are being laid out by princely state kings to bring down the Chola empire and Nandini (Aishwarya Rai) is the mastermind behind it, it is the return of Arunmozhi Varman (Jayam Ravi), who was presumed dead, that squanders all the plans. Aditha Karikalan (Vikram), on the other hand, prepares himself to face the might of Nandini, who has been instrumental in waging a war against the Cholas.\r\n\r\nFor a lot of people, the first part of Ponniyin Selvan couldn\u2019t recreate the magic of SS Rajamouli\u2019s Baahubali series which mesmerized with its grand action set-pieces. This was one of the major complaints for a section of audiences who walked in expecting another grand, action-heavy period epic. However, if one has gotten used to Mani Ratnam\u2019s style and enjoyed PS 1, they have every reason to be blown away by how the auteur just uses drama and politics to create tension throughout the second part. It\u2019s unbelievable how Mani Ratnam actually keeps one engaged with so much drama. For instance, the face-off sequence between Aditya Karikalan and Nandini will go down as one of the best cinematic moments in Tamil cinema. It is the build-up and the mood setting that leads to the showdown makes it one of the best sequences of PS 2.\r\n\r\nThe second part allows each character to be further fleshed out. Arunmozhi Varman gets more screen time and it allows Jayam Ravi to deliver a satisfying performance. Karthi as Vandhiyathevan manages to leave the same impact he managed with his act in the first part. In PS 2, it\u2019s Aishwarya Rai as Nandini and Vikram as Aditya Karikalan who really shine in parts they play so convincingly. Given this is Aishwarya Rai\u2019s big comeback to Tamil cinema after many years, she\u2019s unbelievably good and delivers what\u2019s unarguably a career-best performance. Aishwarya\u2019s character impact is so powerful and she\u2019s so good in it, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else in her shoes. Be it her rage-filled eyes or the long silences, Aishwarya brings so much life into the film. Apart from the gut-wrenching drama, it\u2019s the exquisite visuals that really elevate PS 2 in terms of delivering a larger-than-life viewing experience.

Given this is Aishwarya Rai\u2019s big comeback to Tamil cinema after many years, she\u2019s unbelievably good and delivers what\u2019s unarguably a career-best performance. Aishwarya\u2019s character impact is so powerful and she\u2019s so good in it, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else in her shoes. Be it her rage-filled eyes or the long silences, Aishwarya brings so much life into the film. Apart from the gut-wrenching drama, it\u2019s the exquisite visuals that really elevate PS 2 in terms of delivering a larger-than-life viewing experience. Watching it in IMAX makes it even more irresistible.\r\n\r\nott:10\r\n", "8": "\r\n123telugu.com\r\nPonniyin Selvan 2 Telugu Movie Review\r\n7\u20139 minutes\r\n\r\nReview : Ponniyin Selvan Part 2 \u2013 Watchable sequel\r\n\r\nPonniyin Selvan 2 Telugu Movie Review\r\n\r\nRelease Date : April 28, 2023\r\n\r\n123telugu.com Rating : 3/5\r\n\r\nStarring: Chiyaan Vikram, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Karthi, Jayam Ravi, Trisha, Sobhita Dhulipala, Aishwarya Lekshmi, Prabhu, Jayaram, Vikram Prabhu, Sarathkumar, Prakash Raj, Rahman & others\r\n\r\nDirector: Mani Ratnam\r\n\r\nProducers: Mani Ratnam and Subaskaran\r\n\r\nMusic Director: AR Rahman\r\n\r\nCinematography: Ravi Varman\r\n\r\nEditor: Sreekar Prasad\r\n\r\nRelated Links : Trailer\r\n\r\nAfter seven months of Ponniyin Selvan\u2019s part 1 release, its sequel has hit the screens today. Mani Ratnam directed this star-studded action drama based on the novel Ponniyin Selvan penned by Kalki Krishnamurthy. The first part\u2019s Tamil version was a massive hit, but the reception was not the same in other languages. So let\u2019s see to what extent this sequel entertains.\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n\r\nThe second part begins precisely where the first part ended. Arunmozhi Varman (Jayam Ravi) and Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyadevudu (Karthi), who sank into the sea while fighting with Pandyas get saved by a mute woman Mandhakini (Aishwarya Rai). Later Arunmozhi Varman gets treated by Buddhas in Lanka. At the same time, Nandhini (Aishwarya Rai), along with Pandyas, plans a conspiracy to eradicate the Chola dynasty. This is also the time Chieftains of the Chola dynasty try to make Madhuranthakudu (Rehman) the Chola King by dethroning Aditya Karikaludu (Vikram). What happened later? Who exactly is this Mandhakini? What\u2019s the mystery behind Nandhini looking alike Mandhakini? Did Arunmozhi and Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyadevudu return to the Chola dynasty? Who had the upper hand finally? The movie has the answers.\r\n\r\nPlus Points:\r\n\r\nThe first part was heavily panned in other languages due to its convoluted screenplay and too many characters. But in part two, the screenplay is clear and straightforward without any confusion. All the unanswered questions of Ponniyin Selvan 1 will be answered in this sequel. All the dots are nicely connected towards the end.\r\n\r\nThe drama at places is neat, and there are a few nicely presented sequences in the movie. The focus was mainly on Aishwarya Rai\u2019s character, and she did a fantabulous job as Nandhini. She also played another role as Mandhakini, which is very crucial to the film\u2019s plot. An important sequence between Aishwarya Rai and Chiyaan Vikram which comes in the second half, is too good. Vikram gives a subtle performance as Aditya Karikaludu, and the actor amuses as always.\r\n\r\nJayam Ravi, who played the titular role, did an excellent job. He shines as Raja Raja Chola and brings the royalty required for the character. Again Karthi scores high for his all-round performance. He evokes laughs in the hall with his antics and shares a neat chemistry with Trisha. Karthi\u2019s character is again used here for delivering entertainment.\r\n\r\nOthers like Prakash Raj, Rahman, Sarath Kumar, Parthiban, Kishore, Jaya Chitra, Vikram Prabhu, Sobhita Dhulipala, and Aishwarya Lekshmi are decent in their respective roles. Almost every character, in one or the other way, drives the story forward.\r\n\r\nMinus Points:\r\n\r\nJust like part one, the sequel also suffers from slow pacing, which at times might cause irritation to the viewers. Even the scenes which have neat drama get stretched unnecessarily. The slow-motion close-up shots are way too many in the movie. Had the editing team cut short the length of many scenes, the impact could have been multifold.\r\n\r\nThe movie lacks any high moments though there was a chance to include them. There should have been some adrenaline moments without deviating from the story. This actually could have spiced up things taking the film to the next level. But it looks like the makers wantedly stuck to a flat narrative. This might not work well with all the sections of the audience. The war sequences are clumsy, and they needed better execution.\r\n\r\nTechnical Aspects:\r\n\r\nTechnically Ponniyin Selvan 2 is just splendid. The production design is exquisite, and Thota Tharrani did a stupendous job. The songs by AR Rahman are decent, but his background score in a few scenes is very effective. The cinematography by Ravi Varma is fair. The VFX works are nice, and the production values are fantastic. The editing team should have cut short the film by at least fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nComing to the director, Mani Ratnam, he has done an okay job with the sequel. Though the movie has a decent amount of drama and good performances, the slow-paced narrative hampers the overall impact. That being said that Ponniyin Selvan 2 is definitely a better outing than the first part. The second hour is better than the initial hour, with some exciting moments taking place between the key characters.\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Ponniyin Selvan 2 is a satisfactory sequel that has some interesting and well-executed sequences. The absorbing storyline, decent drama, and solid performances are its assets. PS 2 is surely better than its predecessor, but to enjoy the film, one has to sit through the slow-paced narrative. Give it a shot if you love watching period dramas.\r\n\r\n123telugu.com Rating: 3/5\r\n\r\nReviewed by 123telugu Team\r\n\r\nClick Here For Telugu Review\r\nArticles that might interest you:\r\n\r\n    Bichagadu 2 locks new release date\r\n    Review : Agent \u2013 Mediocre spy thriller\r\n    South Indian actress joins the cast of Saindhav\r\n    Poll : What did you think of \u201cAgent\u201d Movie?\r\n    Poll : What did you think of \u201cPonniyin Selvan 2\u201d Movie?\r\n    Virupaksha\u2019s 1st week AP, TS collection; Sai Tej is back with a bang\r\n\r\nAd : Teluguruchi - Learn..

What he masterfully achieves in just two-part film adaptations of the historical epic (originally written in five volumes) is nothing short of exemplary work by a filmmaker who\u2019s successfully stayed relevant with his work for four decades. With Ponniyin Selvan 2 aka PS 2, Ratnam shows how one can still make historical films without relying too much on grand, over-the-top action sequences but purely on drama that keeps you pinned right till the end.\r\nPonniyin Selvan 2 review: Aishwarya Rai plays Nandini in the movie.\r\nPonniyin Selvan 2 review: Aishwarya Rai plays Nandini in the movie.\r\n\r\nAfter a backstory about the beginning of the relationship between Aditha Karikalan and Nandini as teenagers, the story continues from where the first part ended. As Vandhiyathevan (Karthi) learns that plans are being laid out by princely state kings to bring down the Chola empire and Nandini (Aishwarya Rai) is the mastermind behind it, it is the return of Arunmozhi Varman (Jayam Ravi), who was presumed dead, that squanders all the plans. Aditha Karikalan (Vikram), on the other hand, prepares himself to face the might of Nandini, who has been instrumental in waging a war against the Cholas.\r\n\r\nFor a lot of people, the first part of Ponniyin Selvan couldn\u2019t recreate the magic of SS Rajamouli\u2019s Baahubali series which mesmerized with its grand action set-pieces. This was one of the major complaints for a section of audiences who walked in expecting another grand, action-heavy period epic. However, if one has gotten used to Mani Ratnam\u2019s style and enjoyed PS 1, they have every reason to be blown away by how the auteur just uses drama and politics to create tension throughout the second part. It\u2019s unbelievable how Mani Ratnam actually keeps one engaged with so much drama. For instance, the face-off sequence between Aditya Karikalan and Nandini will go down as one of the best cinematic moments in Tamil cinema. It is the build-up and the mood setting that leads to the showdown makes it one of the best sequences of PS 2.\r\n\r\nThe second part allows each character to be further fleshed out. Arunmozhi Varman gets more screen time and it allows Jayam Ravi to deliver a satisfying performance. Karthi as Vandhiyathevan manages to leave the same impact he managed with his act in the first part. In PS 2, it\u2019s Aishwarya Rai as Nandini and Vikram as Aditya Karikalan who really shine in parts they play so convincingly. Given this is Aishwarya Rai\u2019s big comeback to Tamil cinema after many years, she\u2019s unbelievably good and delivers what\u2019s unarguably a career-best performance. Aishwarya\u2019s character impact is so powerful and she\u2019s so good in it, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else in her shoes. Be it her rage-filled eyes or the long silences, Aishwarya brings so much life into the film. Apart from the gut-wrenching drama, it\u2019s the exquisite visuals that really elevate PS 2 in terms of delivering a larger-than-life viewing experience. Watching it in IMAX makes it even more irresistible.\r\n\r\nott:10\r\n"}
