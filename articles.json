Luciano Spalletti's side managed a few half chances but it was Milan who made the first real impact. \r\n\r\nRafael Leao's quick feet in the Napoli box won his side a penalty, but Olivier Giroud's spot kick was palmed wide by Alex Meret. \r\n\r\nHowever the duo combined again within minutes. Leao's powerful running finding him one-on-one with Meret and the Portuguese forward slid the ball to Giroud for a simple finish. \r\n\r\nNapoli began the second half knowing that they needed two goals to save their European campaign but became increasingly ponderous in possession.\r\n\r\nMilan appeared to be closing the game out expertly when a freak handball, probably fairly given, against Fikayo Tomori presented Napoli with a glorious chance with ten minutes remaining. Kvaratskhelia stepped up and saw his penalty saved by the impressive Mike Maignan in the Milan goal. \r\n\r\nVictor Osimhen pulled one back in the 93rd minute but it was too little to late for the hosts, who fell to a 2-1 aggregate defeat. \r\n\r\nFor Milan it was a glorious night and a return to the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2006/07, the year they were last crowned European champions.\r\n\r\nThey couldn't, could they?\r\n\r\nas.comPublicado a las: 18/04/202323:38CEST\r\n\r\nElite company for tonight's stoppers\r\n\r\nEven in the high-pressure evironment of a Champions League quarter-final, it's pretty rare for goalkeepers to save two spot kicks in a single game.

Napoli have pushed and pulled but the AC Milan back line has stayed, largely, resolute. \r\n\r\nThe hosts carved out a few good chance, with Kvaratskheilia posing a danger from the left throughout. Mike Maignan was called into action a few times in the Milan goal but it was the visitors who enjoyed the clearest of the openings. \r\n\r\nThe first, a penalty for a foul on Rafael Leao, was brilliantly saved by Alex Meret in the Napoli goal but Olivier Giroud made ammends for the miss shortly after. \r\n\r\nOnce again Leao was the architect, this time with a scintillating run from his own half before rolling the ball to Giround to finish. The 36-year-old roared with delight as the ball hit the back of the net two give his side a two-goal cushion. \r\n\r\nNapoli could point to a disallowed goal and a decent shout for a penalty, but with 45 minutes left to play they will have to improve if they are to continue their European adventure. \r\n\r\nas.comPublicado a las: 18/04/202322:02CEST\r\n\r\nAgg: Napoli 0-2 AC Milan\r\n\r\nas.comPublicado a las: 18/04/202321:55CEST\r\n\r\nHalf time: Phew...\r\n\r\nA brilliant first 45 minutes that saw AC Milan double their aggregate lead.

But things look a lot less rosy last summer. \r\n\r\nClub supporters known as Ultras have been on strike at point of the season, essentially boycotting games, due to various grievances. This has included security arrangements, ticket prices, and accusations against owner Aurelio De Laurentiis.\r\n\r\nNapoli's manager, Luciano Spalletti, finds the strike to be a distraction and threatened to resign if it happened again. Any protests have been called off for this game, though, with everyone pushing for an historic end to the season.\r\n\r\nHowever, the club has broadly overperformed under De Laurentiis's leadership, with 13 consecutive seasons in European competition and talented signings such as Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Edinson Cavani, and Dries Mertens. They now stand on the brink of something truly special. \r\n\r\nas.comPublicado a las: 18/04/202320:33CEST\r\n\r\nTeam confirmation: Napoli vs AC Milan\r\n\r\nConfirmation of tonight's teams.

Luciano Spalletti's side managed a few half chances but it was Milan who made the first real impact. \r\n\r\nRafael Leao's quick feet in the Napoli box won his side a penalty, but Olivier Giroud's spot kick was palmed wide by Alex Meret. \r\n\r\nHowever the duo combined again within minutes. Leao's powerful running finding him one-on-one with Meret and the Portuguese forward slid the ball to Giroud for a simple finish. \r\n\r\nNapoli began the second half knowing that they needed two goals to save their European campaign but became increasingly ponderous in possession.\r\n\r\nMilan appeared to be closing the game out expertly when a freak handball, probably fairly given, against Fikayo Tomori presented Napoli with a glorious chance with ten minutes remaining. Kvaratskhelia stepped up and saw his penalty saved by the impressive Mike Maignan in the Milan goal. \r\n\r\nVictor Osimhen pulled one back in the 93rd minute but it was too little to late for the hosts, who fell to a 2-1 aggregate defeat. \r\n\r\nFor Milan it was a glorious night and a return to the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2006/07, the year they were last crowned European champions.\r\n\r\nThey couldn't, could they?\r\n\r\nas.comPublicado a las: 18/04/202323:38CEST\r\n\r\nElite company for tonight's stoppers\r\n\r\nEven in the high-pressure evironment of a Champions League quarter-final, it's pretty rare for goalkeepers to save two spot kicks in a single game.

This has included security arrangements, ticket prices, and accusations against owner Aurelio De Laurentiis.\r\n\r\nNapoli's manager, Luciano Spalletti, finds the strike to be a distraction and threatened to resign if it happened again. Any protests have been called off for this game, though, with everyone pushing for an historic end to the season.\r\n\r\nHowever, the club has broadly overperformed under De Laurentiis's leadership, with 13 consecutive seasons in European competition and talented signings such as Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Edinson Cavani, and Dries Mertens. They now stand on the brink of something truly special. \r\n\r\nas.comPublicado a las: 18/04/202320:33CEST\r\n\r\nTeam confirmation: Napoli vs AC Milan\r\n\r\nConfirmation of tonight's teams.

(1:49)\r\n\r\nAC Milan reached the Champions League semifinals for the first time since they won the trophy 16 years ago thanks to a first-half goal from Olivier Giroud at Napoli that secured a 1-1 draw and 2-1 aggregate win despite a barrage of pressure on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nNapoli battled until the end but could not break down the resilient Milan defence until striker Victor Osimhen equalised three minutes into stoppage time with a bullet header but it was too late as the referee ended the match seconds later.\r\n\r\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\r\n\r\nSeven-time European champions Milan will now face either Inter Milan or Benfica, who meet on Wednesday at the San Siro with the Italian side leading 2-0 from the first leg. Milan coach Stefano Pioli said he would welcome a semi-final against their city rivals.\r\n\r\n\"It would look like that, as Inter won the first leg so well. These will be another two difficult, exciting and wonderful clashes in the Champions League. We've done a great deal and don't want to stop now,\" he told Mediaset.\r\n\r\nThis was the third meeting between Milan and Napoli in 16 days, with Stefano Pioli's visiting side having claimed a 4-0 victory against the runaway Serie A leaders on April 2.\r\n\r\nAfter Milan won the quarterfinal first leg 1-0, Napoli pushed for the opening goal from the start as the visitors were forced to defend deep against an attacking onslaught.\r\n\r\n\"I think the small advantage of the 1-0 in the first leg helped us in one sense and blocked us in another,\" Pioli said. \"We chose, considering Osimhen was there, to sit a little deeper and not allow him those spaces where he can be devastating.\"\r\n\r\nMilan struggled in a raucous atmosphere, with loud boos resounding throughout the stadium every time they gained possession, but they held off an aggressive Napoli side for most of the match with a impressive defensive display.\r\n\r\nMilan had the chance to take the lead with a penalty after 22 minutes after Mario Rui clattered into Rafael Leao but goalkeeper Alex Meret dived to stop Giroud's low strike.\r\n\r\nMeret saved Napoli again when he parried Giroud's attempt inside the box with his foot five minutes later.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the intense pressure exerted by the hosts, Milan were able to exploit the holes in the home defence and went ahead through Giroud just before the interval.\r\n\r\nRafael Leao sprinted with the ball from his own half past the Napoli rearguard before rolling it across to Giroud who slotted home from close range.\r\n\r\nNapoli had a glimmer of hope eight minutes from time when Fikayo Tomori handled the ball inside the box, but Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's penalty was saved by Mike Maignan.\r\n\r\nOsimhen was shackled all night until his added-time header but it came too late for Napoli and their disappointed fans.\r\n\r\n\"I saw an enormous sacrifice from my players, we trusted each other and our way of playing football to overcome a great Napoli side that caused us problems over both legs. We won it with heart, energy and belief,\" Pioli said.\r\n\r\nNapoli, who were in the last eight for the first time, are in a mini-slump without a victory in their last three matches in all competitions.\r\n", "3": "\r\nbbc.com\r\nMilan see off Napoli to reach semi-finals\r\n6\u20137 minutes\r\nOlivier Giroud celebrates\r\nOlivier Giroud, 36, is the fourth oldest goalscorer in Champions League knockout games\r\n\r\nAC Milan reached the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since winning the competition in 2007 as they saw off Serie A rivals Napoli in an incident-packed game.\r\n\r\nMilan could face Inter Milan in the last four, with their city rivals going into Wednesday's second leg with Benfica holding a 2-0 lead.\r\n\r\nSerie A champions-elect Napoli dominated early on - but Milan won a penalty with one of their first attacks, although Olivier Giroud's spot-kick was saved by Alex Meret.\r\n\r\nThe veteran Frenchman got the opening goal, though, to make it 2-0 on aggregate when he tapped in following a sensational 70-yard run by Rafael Leao to set him up.\r\n\r\nNapoli were then gifted a way back into the game when Fikayo Tomori handled in the box, but visiting keeper Mike Maignan saved Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's penalty.\r\n\r\nThey did eventually score, through a Victor Osimhen header with seconds remaining in the match - and there was not enough time to create another chance.\r\n\r\nNapoli, who are 22 points clear of Milan in the league table, have lost form at a critical time and failed to take a host of opportunities, with 39 efforts across both legs.\r\nCan Milan go all the way?\r\n\r\nMilan, soon to be deposed by Napoli as Serie A champions, were seconds away from keeping a remarkable six consecutive Champions League clean sheets.\r\n\r\nBut they will not worry too much about that as they celebrate their best European season for 16 years.\r\n\r\nStefano Pioli's side have clearly focused on this competition, having rested all 10 outfield players in last weekend's Serie A draw with Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe Rossoneri seem to have the number of Napoli too, with two wins and this draw against the same team in April.

Napoli can add another milestone to its extraordinary season.\r\n\r\nFiguring out which team will come out on top after the second leg of their all-Italian Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona may come down to the status of their center forwards.\r\n\r\nSerie A scoring leader Victor Osimhen is back from an injured abductor muscle in his left leg that kept him out of Milan\u2019s 1-0 win in the first game last week. And now veteran Milan striker Olivier Giroud is an injury concern with an Achilles tendon problem.\r\n\r\nMilan won the last of its seven European Cup and Champions League titles in 2007, while Napoli is playing in the quarterfinals for the first time.\r\n\r\nNapoli is also nearing its first Serie A title in more than 30 years, with a 14-point lead over second-place Lazio. Maradona led the southern club to its only two Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990, as well as its only European title in 1989 when Napoli lifted the UEFA Cup.\r\n\r\nOsimhen returned in the second half of Napoli\u2019s 0-0 draw with Hellas Verona on Sunday in Serie A and showed immediately how dangerous he can be by rattling a shot off the crossbar.\r\n\r\n\u201cOsimhen has this physicality and speed whereby you can throw the ball up to him and he can protect it, use his head or use a change of pace,\u201d Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti said. \u201cHe has so many different alternatives.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe 24-year-old Osimhen has been one of the top strikers in Europe this season with 25 goals in 29 appearances across all competitions.\r\n\r\nAt age 36, Giroud leads Milan with 12 goals in 37 games. But the France international had to sit out training on Sunday, possibly leaving coach Stefano Pioli to choose from Ante Rebic and Divock Origi as a replacement \u2013 with Zlatan Ibrahimovic also out injured.\r\n\r\nIsmael Bennacer scored for Milan in the first leg, which also included two yellow cards to physical Napoli midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa.\r\n\r\nZambo Anguissa and Napoli\u2019s top center back Kim Min-jae, who is suspended for accumulated cards, will both miss the second leg.\r\n\r\n(from AP)\r\n\r\nWhen and where to watch Napoli vs AC Milan?\r\n\r\nWhen and where will Napoli vs AC Milan be played?\r\n\r\nThe Champions League quarterfinal between Napoli and AC Milan will be played at the Diego Maradona Stadium in Naples.
