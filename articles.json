RR need 132 off 72.\r\nRead more\r\n\r\nButtler early in the chase.\r\n\r\nHardik Pandya landed the first blow in Jaiswal following which Mohammed Shami sent back Buttler for a duck. A fine show from spinners in the middle overs allowed Rajasthan Royals to keep Gujarat Titans batters in check. David Miller top-scored with 46 while Shubman Gill made as GT posted a challenging 177/7 in 20 overs. They lost Wriddhiman Saha and Sai Sudharsan early in the Powerplay before Gill and captain Hardik Pandya stitched a solid partnership to drive the innings.\r\n\r\nSanju Samson, captain of Rajasthan Royals, won the toss and opted to field first against Gujarat Titans. Trent Boult is back for the visitors while GT will be without Vijay Shankar who has been replaced by Abhinav Manohar.\r\n\r\nThe last year\u2019s finalists will come face to face again in what is expected to be a thrilling affair at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals were clearly the two best teams of the last season and fittingly contested the final as well. However, GT maintained their winning streak against the inaugural champions as they roared to a third straight win over them and in the process became the winners on debut.\r\n\r\nThe winner of tonight\u2019s clash will also claim the top spot on the points table as well. So far, GT have won three of their four matches for six points. On the other hand, RR have also won three of their four matches so far for six points. The Sanju Samson-led RR are ahead of Hardik Pandya\u2019s GT because of a better net run-rate.\r\n\r\nGT bounced back from their first defeat of the season as they completed yet another last-over win over Punjab Kings in Mohali. The contest also saw the return of Pandya into the eleven after he missed the defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders.\r\n\r\nRR have been in red-hot form. They started their campaign with a win and a defeat before jotting together two wins in a row including against struggling Delhi Capitals and a tough Chennai Super Kings.\r\n\r\nRR though have a fitness concern. Their star pacer Trent Boult missed the CSK game due to a what was described as a \u2018small niggle\u2019.  They will be hoping their strike bowler to make a full recovery. GT have no injury concern.\r\n\r\nRR\u2019s success this season has been built on the form of their openers \u2013 Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler. These two have helped them set high scores which the bowlers have backed themselves to defend. Additionally, their spinners \u2013 Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal \u2013 have been in fine form as well.\r\n\r\nGet the latest Cricket News, IPL 2023 Live Score, Orange Cap and Purple Cap holder details here\r\n", "5": "\r\nnews18.com\r\nGT vs RR Highlights, IPL 2023: Sanju Samson, Shimron Hetmyer Fifties Guide Rajasthan Royals to Three-wicket Win\r\nFeroz Khan\r\n12\u201316 minutes\r\n\r\nApr 16, 2023 23:57 IST\r\nRajasthan Royals Beat Gujarat Titans For The First Time\r\n\r\nSanju Samson top-scored with 60 while Shimron Hetmyer made an unbeaten 56 off 26 in Rajasthan Royals\u2019 three-wicket win over Gujarat Titans in an IPL 2023 clash on Sunday night in Ahmedabad.

RR 47/3 in 8.3 overs, chasing 178.\r\n\r\nApr 16, 2023 22:08 IST\r\nGujarat Titans vs Rajasthan Royals Live: GT Waste a Review\r\n\r\nHardik Pandya goes for a review after a not out lbw decision off his own bowling. No bat involved as ultra edge clears but the ball would have missed the leg stump as per the ball-tracker. And then Sanju Samson responds with a gentle push through covers for a delightful boundary. 8 runs from the over. RR 46/2 in 8 overs, chasing 178. Time-out. RR need 132 off 72.\r\nRead more\r\n\r\nButtler early in the chase.\r\n\r\nHardik Pandya landed the first blow in Jaiswal following which Mohammed Shami sent back Buttler for a duck. A fine show from spinners in the middle overs allowed Rajasthan Royals to keep Gujarat Titans batters in check. David Miller top-scored with 46 while Shubman Gill made as GT posted a challenging 177/7 in 20 overs. They lost Wriddhiman Saha and Sai Sudharsan early in the Powerplay before Gill and captain Hardik Pandya stitched a solid partnership to drive the innings.\r\n\r\nSanju Samson, captain of Rajasthan Royals, won the toss and opted to field first against Gujarat Titans. Trent Boult is back for the visitors while GT will be without Vijay Shankar who has been replaced by Abhinav Manohar.\r\n\r\nThe last year\u2019s finalists will come face to face again in what is expected to be a thrilling affair at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals were clearly the two best teams of the last season and fittingly contested the final as well. However, GT maintained their winning streak against the inaugural champions as they roared to a third straight win over them and in the process became the winners on debut.\r\n\r\nThe winner of tonight\u2019s clash will also claim the top spot on the points table as well. So far, GT have won three of their four matches for six points. On the other hand, RR have also won three of their four matches so far for six points. The Sanju Samson-led RR are ahead of Hardik Pandya\u2019s GT because of a better net run-rate.\r\n\r\nGT bounced back from their first defeat of the season as they completed yet another last-over win over Punjab Kings in Mohali. The contest also saw the return of Pandya into the eleven after he missed the defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders.\r\n\r\nRR have been in red-hot form. They started their campaign with a win and a defeat before jotting together two wins in a row including against struggling Delhi Capitals and a tough Chennai Super Kings.\r\n\r\nRR though have a fitness concern. Their star pacer Trent Boult missed the CSK game due to a what was described as a \u2018small niggle\u2019.  They will be hoping their strike bowler to make a full recovery. GT have no injury concern.\r\n\r\nRR\u2019s success this season has been built on the form of their openers \u2013 Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler. These two have helped them set high scores which the bowlers have backed themselves to defend. Additionally, their spinners \u2013 Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal \u2013 have been in fine form as well.\r\n\r\nGet the latest Cricket News, IPL 2023 Live Score, Orange Cap and Purple Cap holder details here\r\n", "6": "\r\nLoading\u2026\r\n", "7": "\r\nLoading\u2026\r\n", "8": "\r\nLoading\u2026\r\n", "9": "\r\nsportskeeda.com\r\nGujarat Titans vs Rajasthan Royals\r\nSportskeeda Desk\r\n2\u20133 minutes\r\n\r\nRajasthan Royals won by 3 wickets\r\n\r\nGujarat Titans 177/7 in 20 overs\r\n\r\nDavid Miller 46(30) | Shubman Gill 45(34)\r\nSandeep Sharma 2/25(4) | Adam Zampa 1/32(4)\r\n\r\nRajasthan Royals 179/7 in 19.2 overs\r\n\r\nSanju Samson 60(32) | Shimron Hetmyer 56*(26)\r\nMohammed Shami 3/25(4) | Rashid Khan 2/46(4)\r\n\r\nThat is one heck of an innings from Shimron Hetmyer. Along with Sanju Samson, the duo has won them the game from a hopeless situation. This also proves the importance of Hetmyer as the finisher in this Rajasthan team. He has lived up to the expectations so far and the Royals finally get one past the Titans. They lost all their three games against GT in the previous edition but they have gone one better already in 2023. A great game yet again and the Titans will need to ponder on their bowling towards the end. \r\n\r\nThe Rajasthan Royals got off to the worst possible start, losing their two openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler inside the 3rd over. It was incredible new ball bowling from Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya and put them on the backfoot straightaway. From there on, it was Devdutt Padikkal and Sanju Samson who tried to steady the ship. The stylish left-hander played some delightful shots before perishing to Rashid Khan. \r\n\r\nRiyan Parag's struggles continued as he fell for yet another low score but Samson found an able ally in Shimron Hetmyer who looked in complete command of proceedings right from the word go. Samson was hitting them big and smashed Rashid Khan for a hat-trick of sixes. He was eventually dismissed by the impact sub Noor Ahmad but he had provided a platform for the likes of Hetmyer and Jurel to seal the deal. \r\n\r\n Dhruv Jurel then came out with a positive frame of mind and scored a quickfire 18 off 10 deliveries. Ravichandran Ashwin almost sealed it for them with a four and a six of the penultimate over but the drama continued as he was dismissed very next ball. Noor Ahmad was handed over the ball for the final over and Hetmyer smashed him for a six over deep midwicket to win it for the Royals. \r\n", "10": "\r\nsportskeeda.com\r\nGujarat Titans vs Rajasthan Royals\r\nSportskeeda Desk\r\n2\u20133 minutes\r\n\r\nRajasthan Royals won by 3 wickets\r\n\r\nGujarat Titans 177/7 in 20 overs\r\n\r\nDavid Miller 46(30) | Shubman Gill 45(34)\r\nSandeep Sharma 2/25(4) | Adam Zampa 1/32(4)\r\n\r\nRajasthan Royals 179/7 in 19.2 overs\r\n\r\nSanju Samson 60(32) | Shimron Hetmyer 56*(26)\r\nMohammed Shami 3/25(4) | Rashid Khan 2/46(4)\r\n\r\nThat is one heck of an innings from Shimron Hetmyer.
